# Road-Map

### Remove `ZenScroll` library

    While this library is useful for smoothscrolling with padding, it's not worth the extra http request,
    therefor it can be replaced with a lighter alternative in `wiki.js` much like the `Navigo` routing library was replaced.

### PWA : Progressive Web Application

    Wiki3 can be installed like an app and used offline.

The aim of Wiki3 is to be fast and minimal, no mater how old and unattractive the coding methods seems to be.
